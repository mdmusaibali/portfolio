        I'm VIth semester student at P.D.A College of Engineering. I LOVE
        programming and developing new STUFF. Last year has been awesome for me.
        I got to learn many programming languages and made many stunning
        websites. I try to keep up with design and technology trends.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've completed learning HTML, CSS, MySQL and JavaScript last year and
        React.js this year. I'm currently learning Typescript. There's always a
        new thing to learn. It's like a never ending cycleðŸ˜‰.
        <br />
        <br />I get a lot of interesting ideas in my mind and i've always
        preferred to implement them rather than just keeping them in the brain.
        I'm aspiring to become a successful Full Stack Developer one day.
